Random Number Generators
======================

This repository holds several plugins used as random number providers for Monte Carlo simulations in Fairmat.

Random Sources Support: a plugin providing a simple interface for random number providers implementations. It handles several common needs for random number sources so the implementation of the actual single sources is minimal.

QRNG Web Service: a plugin which uses the University of Berlin provided random numbers web service to gather numbers for use in simulations.
