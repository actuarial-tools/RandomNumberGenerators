Random Sources Support
======================

The Random Source Support plug-in allows Fairmat to use external random stream sequences as input to the Monte Carlo simulation simulator.

This plug-in provides a general infrastructure and a file system based caching support for the random streams, which allows developers to easily define new random sources by using the Fairmat extensions framework.
