QRNG Web Service
======================

The QRNG Webservice plug-in allows Fairmat to use a free service hosted by the physic department of the university of Berlin as source of random numbers needed from Fairmat for the Monte-Carlo simulation.

Random numbers are generated by exploiting quantum physic properties: from the authors: We provide a new quantum random number generator (QRNG) based on the quantum randomness of photon arrival times. It promises provable and long term statistical quality, speed as well as affordability (see http://qrng.physik.hu-berlin.de for more details).
